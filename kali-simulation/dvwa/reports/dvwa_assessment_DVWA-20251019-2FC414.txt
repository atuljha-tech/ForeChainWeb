AUTHENTICATION BYPASS:
=====================
✅ SQL Injection bypass successful
✅ No CAPTCHA implementation
✅ Weak password policy

SECURITY CONTROLS ASSESSMENT:
============================
INPUT VALIDATION:
- Client-side only validation
- No server-side input sanitization
- No prepared statements for SQL

SESSION MANAGEMENT:
- Session cookies not secure flagged
- No session timeout implemented
- Session fixation possible

ACCESS CONTROLS:
- Inadequate authorization checks
- Direct object reference vulnerability
- Privilege escalation possible

REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
===========================
1. Implement parameterized queries for SQL
2. Enable server-side input validation
3. Restrict file upload types and locations
4. Implement proper session security
5. Add CSRF tokens to all forms
6. Disable error reporting in production

TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS:
========================
- Focus on secure coding practices
- OWASP Top 10 awareness training
- Regular security code reviews
- Penetration testing exercises
